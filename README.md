Heyo! [Website](https://core310.github.io/arika/)

I'm a heavy Obsidan user of which will (hopefully) publish my workflow soon.

If you want to check out an annotated list of my projects you can visit my website!

Currently, I'm working on robotics in several projects, though I'm still starting out and learning (forever learning)..
